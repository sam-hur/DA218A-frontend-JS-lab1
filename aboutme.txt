I am currently 26 years old and I struggled a long time to find a passion in life, but ultimately realized that what I want to do is work in an academic setting where I may utilize the skills picked up during this degree with my love for animals and evolutionary ecology. Once my undergrad studies are complete, I will work towards a postgrad degree in bioinformatics first. Next, I aim to complete a second MSc in evolutionary ecology to compliment my skills, ensuring that I build up relevant experience in the meantime.

I currently hold 5 credits in web development fundamentals from my time at CIT (Ireland) in 2013. However, I do not really remember much at all so I am treating this as a refresher course.
